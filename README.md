# ✈️ US Domestic Airline Delays  
### Analyzing Flight Performance and Delay Patterns Across the United States  

## 📦 Project Overview
This project explores the performance and delay statistics of US domestic airline flights using interactive dashboards and data analysis techniques. It aims to uncover delay causes, seasonal patterns, and operational inefficiencies to help improve airline services and passenger experience.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `airline_data.csv` — Dataset containing flight delay and performance metrics  
- `app.py` — Dash application code for interactive dashboard  
- `README.md` — Project documentation and usage guide  

## 🗂️ Database Used
The dataset was sourced from [data.world's Airline On-Time Performance Statistics](https://data.world/dot/airline-on-time-performance-statistics), which includes comprehensive flight-level data reported by US carriers to the Department of Transportation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize **monthly flight cancellations**, diverted landings, and flight counts  
- Analyze **average flight time** and **delay causes** (weather, carrier, NAS, security, late aircraft)  
- Map **flight origins and destinations** across US states  
- Provide **yearly performance and delay reports** for stakeholders  

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized formats  
- **EDA**: Used Pandas and Plotly for statistical analysis  
- **Dashboard Development**: Built with Dash for interactivity and user-friendly navigation  
- **Visualization**: Choropleth maps, treemaps, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs
